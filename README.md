Hi All!

REDUMP:
- naming matches the latest Redump dat
- original packaging if possible (big box > jewel case)
- additional real/fake jewel-box covers for people who want to have everything 'squared' (512x512pix)
- titles/snaps added in original resolution (320x256pix x 8bit - probabably 96% of cases)
- the thumbset fully works with both Scan Directory (DAT file based scanning) and Manual Scan (create list form the zips in a folder)

TOSEC:
 - database added; naming matches the latest TOSEC-Games ISO/BIN/IMG DATs
 - alternative set of boxarts (512x512); high resolution sources
 - titles/snaps added in original resolution (320x256pix x 8bit - probabably 96% of cases)
 - the thumbset fully works with both Scan Directory (DAT file based scanning) and Manual Scan (playlist created form the zips in a folder)

COVERDISCS:
 - thumbset covers both TOSEC-Coverdiscs-ISO dat and coverdiscs from the Redump set

AMIGAJAY compilations:
  - work in progress

In case of any problems/suggestions, please let me know.
Cheers!
